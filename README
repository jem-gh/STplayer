# STconverter 2 allows you to execute Python scripts written for SimpleGUI on 
# a machine configured with Tkinter GUI instead. 
# 
# STconverter 2 is the successor of STconverter, and is different in such ways 
# it has been entirely rewritten to handle with a totally different approach 
# the "conversion". 
# While the first version of STconverter was converting each SimpleGUI operation 
# in the user code to be executable by Tkinter, STconverter 2 is an API between 
# SimpleGUI operations and Tkinter. 
# 
# "Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package"
# (http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
# "SimpleGUI is a custom Python graphical user interface (GUI) module implemented 
# directly in CodeSkulptor that provides an easy to learn interface for building 
# interactive programs in Python" (http://www.codeskulptor.org) used for the 
# online Coursera course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" 
# by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong (Rice University) 
# 
# I want to thank Amín Guzmán for his valuable comments and suggestions on how 
# to improve STconverter, which lead to the development of STconverter 2

2. REQUIREMENTS

2.1. To run STconverter

- Python & Tkinter: STconverter will need Python installed on your machine with 
the Tkinter module (generally installed by default with Python) to run correctly.
http://www.python.org/download/


2.2. Minimum configuration to run your program on your machine

A simple rule of thumb is:
										Additional module(s)	Works with Python
your program has NO music and NO image		none					2.7 or 3
your program has music						pygame					2.7 or 3
your program has image						PIL						2.7 only

- Music: if your SimpleGUI program plays music, you will need in addition to have 
pygame installed on your machine to run your program (but is not required for the 
conversion)
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

- Image: if your SimpleGUI program displays images, you will need in addition to 
have the Python Imaging Library (PIL) with the ImageTk module installed on your 
machine to run your program (but are not required for the conversion).
Unfortunately, so far, PIL is not available for Python 3 and works only for 
Python 2.2 to 2.7.

3. HOW TO USE


Copy the API in your Python working directory
In your SimpleGUI file, change:
	import simplegui
by
	from simplegui2tkinter_API import simplegui2tkinter as simplegui



4. MAJOR KNOWN ISSUES

> frame.start() 
frame.start() has to be your last line of code. If a timer.start() is written 
afterwards, it won't start.

> Music/Sound sound.pause() 
sound.pause() hasn't been implemented yet.

> Global Variables 
SimpleGUI handles very well global variables which were assigned "locally" 
in a function. This is generally not the case of your Python interpreter. 

> Divisions 
Division on Python 2.7 returns the floor of the quotient, whereas on Python 3 
and SimpleGUI it returns the true division result. This could result on a 
different behavior of your program depending on which Python you have installed. 



5. TESTED ON...

So far, it has been tested on:
- Linux with Python 2.7.3, pygame 1.9.1, and PIL 1.1.7



6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I want to thank Amín Guzmán for his valuable comments and suggestions on how to 
improve the first version of STconverter, which lead to the development of 
STconverter 2
