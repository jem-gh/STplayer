# STconverter 2 allows you to execute Python scripts written for SimpleGUI on 
# a machine configured with Tkinter GUI instead. 
# 
# STconverter 2 is the successor of STconverter, and is different in such ways 
# it has been entirely rewritten to handle with a totally different approach 
# the "conversion". 
# While the first version of STconverter was converting each SimpleGUI operation 
# in the user code to be executable by Tkinter, STconverter 2 is an API between 
# SimpleGUI operations and Tkinter. 
# 
# "Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package"
# (http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
# "SimpleGUI is a custom Python graphical user interface (GUI) module implemented 
# directly in CodeSkulptor that provides an easy to learn interface for building 
# interactive programs in Python" (http://www.codeskulptor.org) used for the 
# online Coursera course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" 
# by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong (Rice University) 
# 
# I want to thank Amín Guzmán for his comments and suggestions on how to improve 
# STconverter, which lead to the development of STconverter 2
# 
# For the latest version of STConverter 2 visit the repository on Github:

# STconverter 2 is developed by Jean-Etienne Morlighem

STILL IN EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT!
FEW METHODS ARE SUPPORTED SO FAR!



HOW TO USE

Download the simplegui2tkinter.py API file.

Copy it in the Python working directory.

On your SimpleGUi file, just modify:
	import simplegui
by
	import simplegui2tkinter as simplegui
